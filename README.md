### Tech

Notes uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Angular 4] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Visual Studio Code Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [NPM] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - duh
* [Java] - best applicaton language out there
* [Spring Boot] - really great assistive application framework
* [Mongo DB Community Server] - an unstructured No-SQL DB

### Installation
There are two microservices in this system -
* Frontend (Angular 4)
* Backend (Java + Spring Boot + Mongo)

#### Frontend Usage
* Notes requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.11.x to run.
* Install Angular CLI 1.4.3
* Go to Frontend project directory and run -
```sh
$ npm install
```
* Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server -
```sh
$ ng serve --port 4200
```

### Backend Usage
* Install Mongo Db Server and start it
* Run following commands on the cmd-let where you started mongo server
```sh
$ use dbs notes
$ db.createCollection("notes")
```
* Go to Notes Directory(Backend), and clone it
* Run it as Spring Boot application

* Now the application is available to be used on browser at <http://localhost:4200>
